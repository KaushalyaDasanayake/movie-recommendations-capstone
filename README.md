# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System — Machine Learning Capstone

## 📌 Project Overview

This project builds a movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering techniques to recommend movies based on user similarity and item similarity. It also explores matrix factorization using SVD to learn latent features of users and movies.

The objective is to simulate real-world recommender systems used in streaming platforms.
